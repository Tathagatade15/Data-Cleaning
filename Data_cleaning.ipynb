        "1.  What is data cleaning, and why is it important in data analysis?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Data cleaning (or data scrubbing) is the process of detecting and correcting or removing corrupt, inaccurate, or irrelevant records from a record set, table, or database.\n",
        "  \n",
        "It's important because data analysis results are only as good as the data they are based on. Clean data ensures accuracy, consistency, and reliability in analysis, leading to valid conclusions and better decision-making.\n",
        "\n",
        "> What are the potential consequences of analyzing unclean or messy data?\n",
        "\n",
        " - The potential consequences include:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Misleading conclusions: Analysis based on faulty data can lead to incorrect insights.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Flawed decisions: Business or strategic decisions based on poor insights will likely be ineffective or harmful.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Wasted resources: Time and effort spent analyzing, modeling, and interpreting bad data.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Inconsistent results: Different analyses may yield conflicting outcomes.\n",
        "\n",
        "> Explain the common steps involved in cleaning and organizing data.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Common steps typically involve:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Auditing/Profiling: Assessing the data quality (identifying missing values, duplicates, inconsistencies).\n",
        "\n",
        "* Handling Missing Data: Imputing values or removing records/columns with too much missing data.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Standardizing and Parsing: Ensuring data is in a uniform format (e.g., date formats, address structures).\n",
        "\n",
        "* Deduplication: Identifying and removing duplicate records.\n",
        "Validation: Checking data against a set of rules or constraints (e.g., values within an acceptable range).\n",
        "\n",
        "* Transformation/Normalization: Converting data into a suitable format for analysis (e.g., changing text case, aggregating/disaggregating data).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. How would you sort the following dataset first by \"Department\" (A-Z) and then by \"Salary\" (Largest to Smallest)? Write a step-by-step approach.\n",
        "\n",
        " - The steps involve a two-level sort:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Select the entire data range (A2 to C5).\n",
        "\n",
        "* Apply a Custom Sort feature.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Primary Sort Level: Sort by the \"Department\" column, in order A to Z (or smallest to largest).\n",
        "\n",
        "* Secondary Sort Level: Add a second level and sort by the \"Salary\" column, in order Largest to Smallest (or descending).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Explain the use of text functions such as TRIM , LEFT, RIGHT, MID, and CONCAT in data cleaning.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Text functions are crucial for manipulating string data to ensure uniformity and extract necessary information:\n",
        "\n",
        "* TRIM: Removes extra spaces from text, including leading, trailing, and repeated spaces between words. This cleans up inconsistent spacing.\n",
        "\n",
        "* LEFT/RIGHT: Extracts a specified number of characters from the start (LEFT) or end (RIGHT) of a text string. Used to extract codes, prefixes, or suffixes.\n",
        "\n",
        "* MID: Extracts a specified number of characters from a text string, starting from a given position. Used to extract data embedded in the middle of a string, like a product code or ID.\n",
        "\n",
        "* CONCAT (or CONCATENATE): Joins two or more text strings into one. Used to combine first and last names, or create a full address from separate cells.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the role of date functions like TODAY in managing datasets?\n",
        "\n",
        " - The TODAY() function returns the current date. Its primary role in dataset management is to:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Timestamping: Automatically record the date a report was generated or a data entry was made.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Dynamic Calculations: Calculate age, duration, or deadlines relative to the current date (e.g., calculating days overdue for an invoice).\n",
        "\n",
        "*Filtering: Use the current date as a dynamic criterion for filtering data (e.g., filtering for tasks due after today).\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  Apply Data Validation to restrict Quantity values to only whole numbers between 1 and 10.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - To apply this Data Validation to the \"Quantity\" column, you would select the cells in that column (e.g., D2:D10 based on the image) and follow these steps in the Data Validation dialog box.\n",

        "a. Configure an input message that appears when a user selects a cell in the \"Quantity\" column explaining:\"Please enter a whole number between 1 and 10.\"\n",

        "\n",
        "  [=A1-TodayA()]\n",
        "\n",
        "This formula subtracts the current date (returned by TODAY()) from the future date in cell A1 (2025-06-10), giving the number of days remaining. Note: If A1 contains a date earlier than today, the result will be a negative number.\n",

        " [=Text(Now(),\"MM/DD/YYYY H:MM AM/PM\")]\n",

        "\n",
        " - When the worksheet is reopened the next day, the value in the cell will automatically update to the new current date.\n",
        "\n",
        "Explanation: TODAY() is a volatile function. This means it recalculates every time the spreadsheet is opened or whenever a change is made to any other cell on the sheet that forces a recalculation. It always displays the date according to your computer's system clock at the moment of calculation.\n",
